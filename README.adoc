# cnl-main-repository
The main repository of the Architecture Controlled Natural Language project.

## About the approach

- ontology-based formalization of architecture language and architecture rules
- using reasoning services built-upon description logics and the semantic web, architecture rules can be validated against source code in order to detect architecture violations

The table below lists the repositories of the CNL project.

|===
| CNL Toolchain  | Combines all the components to a tool chain for performing conformance checking | https://github.com/sandrellaella/cnl-toolchain[^]
| architecture-cnl | grammar of the CNL and generation of OWL axioms | https://github.com/sandrellaella/architecture-cnl[^]
| owlify  | Several generators for transforming software artefacts into an ontology-based representation | https://github.com/sandrellaella/owlify[^]
| cnl-common  | Common data types for the CNL tool chain | https://github.com/sandrellaella/cnl-common[^]
| cnl-verify  | Component that performs the actual conformance checking. | https://github.com/sandrellaella/cnl-verify[^]
| cnl-documentation  | Integrates CNL in well-known architecture documentation templates in an asciidoc format, e.g. arc42 and architecture decision records (ADR).| https://github.com/sandrellaella/cnl-documentation[^]
| architecture-to-code-mapper | Maps the architecture concepts and relations to source code elements. Mapping rules are specified as SWRL rules. The mapping is performed using rule-based reasoning. | https://github.com/sandrellaella/architecture-to-code-mapper[^]
| stardog-connector | Connection to the Stardog Database where architectural rules and source code artefacts are stored and with which integrity constraints are validated . | https://github.com/sandrellaella/stardog-connector[^]
